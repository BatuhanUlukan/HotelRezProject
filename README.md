# Project About
Using SQL Server as a database, N Tier Architecture architectures consisting of BusinessLayer, DataAccessLayer, DTOLayer, EntityLayer, PresentationLayer, SignalRApiForSQL and SingalRConsume layers are supported and coded with APIs with Codefirst discussion using ASP.Net Core 5.0 and Entity Framework Core technologies. In addition, MSSQL and Postgre SQL databases were also used.

This project represents a web feature operating under the holiday limitation. It is a project with three different owners, where various holiday options are listed on the site, users can access their personal accounts and information about the site, and the administrative user can perform CRUD operations included in the site.
